### Multi-Tenant Implementation
```php
// Tenant isolation and data security
class TenantMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $tenant = $this->resolveTenant($request);
        app()->instance('tenant', $tenant);
        config(['database.connections.tenant.database' => $tenant->database]);
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```
